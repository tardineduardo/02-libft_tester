This is a libft tester created by Bruna, Eduardo and Natalia. It's our first tester! Our goal is to learn how to create our own testers, how to create Makefiles, how compilation works and how to colaborate on git. 

This test checks each function individually. We are not checkig the compilation requirements of the exercise.

Don't rely on us to check if your functions work! Expect all types of compilation errors, logic errors, inacurate results. But we accept constructive feedback. This is our baby, it's ugly but we love it anyway. 

How to use:

From inside your libft folder, clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/tardineduardo/libft_tester.git

open the test folder:
cd libft_tester

run the tests:
make



- We are still learning how to create more complex and dynamic Makefiles, so for this version you need to follow stricter rules:

--- Your main libft folder can't have any .c files other than the ones expected by the exercise.
--- All .c files to be tested need this header -> #include "libft.h"
